`crux.api` exposes a union of methods from `ICruxNode` and `ICruxDatasource`,
with few lifecycle members added.

     When a valid time is specified then returned db value contains only those
     documents whose valid time is not after the specified. Non-blocking.

     as of the valid and transaction time. Will block until the transaction
     time is present in the index.")

    blocks until the node has caught up indexing the tx-log
    backlog. Will throw an exception on timeout. The returned date is
    the latest index time when this node has caught up as of this

    Evaluates *lazily* consequently returns lazy sequence of result tuples.")
----

=== history-ascending

----


== Lifecycle members

=== start-cluster-node

----
(defn start-cluster-node ^ICruxAPI [options])
----

Starts a query node in local library mode.

For valid options, see crux.bootstrap/cli-options. Options are
specified as keywords using their long format name, like
:bootstrap-servers etc.

NOTE: requires any KV store dependencies and kafka-clients on
the classpath. The crux.kv.memdb.MemKv KV backend works without
additional dependencies.

The HTTP API can be started by passing the node to
crux.http-server/start-http-server. This will require further
dependencies on the classpath, see crux.http-server for
details.

Options:
----
{:kv-backend        "crux.kv.rocksdb.RocksKv" ; requires RocksDB as dep
                    "crux.kv.memdb.MemKv" ; will work without additional deps
:bootstrap-servers  "kafka-cluster-kafka-brokers.crux.svc.cluster.local:9092"
:event-log-dir      "data/eventlog-1"
:db-dir             "data/db-dir-1"
:backup-dir         "checkpoint"
:group-id           "group-id"
:tx-topic           "crux-transaction-log"
:doc-topic          "crux-docs"
:create-topics      true
:doc-partitions     1
:replication-factor 1
:db-dir             "data"
:server-port        3000
:await-tx-timeout   10000
:doc-cache-size     131072
:object-store       "crux.index.KvObjectStore"}
----

Returns the started local node that implements ICruxAPI and
java.io.Closeable. Latter allows the node to be stopped
by calling `(.close node)`.

Throws IndexVersionOutOfSyncException if the index needs rebuilding.

=== start-standalone-node

----
(defn start-standalone-node ^ICruxAPI [options])
----

Creates a minimal standalone node writing the transaction log
into its local KV store without relying on
Kafka. Alternatively, when the event-log-dir option is
provided, using two KV stores to enable rebuilding the index
from the event log, being more similar to the semantics of
Kafka but for a single process only.

NOTE: requires any KV store dependencies on the classpath. The
crux.kv.memdb.MemKv KV backend works without additional dependencies.

Options:
----
{:kv-backend    "crux.kv.rocksdb.RocksKv" ; or crux.kv.memdb.MemKv
 :event-log-dir "data/eventlog-1"
 :db-dir        "data/db-dir-1"
 :backup-dir    "checkpoint"}
----

See `start-cluster-node` doc for more options

Returns a standalone node which implements ICruxAPI and
java.io.Closeable. Latter allows the node to be stopped
by calling `(.close node)`.

Throws IndexVersionOutOfSyncException if the index needs rebuilding.

Throws NonMonotonicTimeException if the clock has moved backwards since
last run. Only applicable when using the event log.

=== new-api-client

----
(defn new-api-client ^ICruxAPI [url])
----

Creates a new remote API client ICruxAPI. The remote client
requires valid and transaction time to be specified for all
calls to `db`.

NOTE: requires either clj-http or http-kit on the classpath,
see crux.bootstrap.remove-api-client/*internal-http-request-fn*
for more information.

Param `url` the URL to a Crux HTTP end-point.

Returns a remote API client.
