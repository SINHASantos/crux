= Patterns

== Introduction

Here we document patterns and helpful functions that have been
suggested by users. A broad understanding of these patterns will be
useful to guide iterations on the next generation of API layers for
Crux. Some of these patterns may be appropriate candidates for
evolving into easily consumable <<advanced.adoc#_decorators,decorators>>.

== Implicit Node

```
(defn q
  [query]
  (crux/q (crux/db node) query))

(defn entity
  [entity-id]
  (crux/entity (crux/db node) entity-id))

; by @spacegangster
```

== Entities

```
(defn lookup-vector
 [db eid]
 (if (vector? eid)
   (let [[index value] eid]
     (recur
       db
       (ffirst
         (crux.api/q db
                     {:find ['?e]
                      :where [['?e index value]]}))))
   (crux.api/entity db eid)))
