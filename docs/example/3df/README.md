# Crux 3DF Spike

Example of the crux-dataflow module.

From another terminal, build and run the declarative-dataflow v0.2.0
server directly from git:

```
git clone https://github.com/comnik/declarative-dataflow/tree/v0.2.0
git checkout v0.2.0
cd server
cargo build
cargo run
```

(This example project also contains a Dockerfile and a
docker-compose.yml, but they are using HEAD and not pinned to a
specific version of declarative-dataflow.)

Run the example:

```
lein run
```

My impression is that this doesn't fully work, but there's some
output.
