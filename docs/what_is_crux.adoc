== What is Crux?

Crux—to use Martin Kleppmann’s phrase—is an _unbundled_
database.

What do we have to gain from turning the database inside out? Simpler code,
better scalability, better robustness, lower latency, and more flexibility for
doing interesting things with data.

It is a database turned inside out, using:

* Apache Kafka for the primary storage of transactions and documents
as semi-immutable logs.
* RocksDB or LMDB to host indexes for rich query support.

This decoupled design enables Crux to be maintained as a small and efficient
core that can be scaled and evolved to support a large variety of use-cases.

Crux is an open source document database with bitemporal graph queries.

== Get Started

Reading the documentation is a good way to learn about Crux, so you are in
the right place! <<get_started.adoc#,Let's continue the journey.>>

== Bitemporal

Crux is a _bitemporal_ database that stores _transaction time_ and _valid time_
histories. While a _[uni]temporal_ database enables "time travel" querying
through the transactional sequence of database states from the moment of
database creation to its current state, Crux also provides "time travel"
querying for a discrete valid time axis without unnecessary design complexity
or performance impact. This means a Crux user can populate the database with
past and future information regardless of the order in which the information
arrives, and make corrections to past recordings to build an ever-improving
temporal model of a given domain.

Bitemporal modelling is broadly useful for event-based architectures and is a
critical requirement for systems in any industry with strong auditing regulations,
where you need to be able to answer the question "what did you know and when
did you know it?".

<<bitemp.adoc#,Read more about Bitemporality in Crux>> or specifically the
<<bitemp.adoc#_known_uses,known uses>> for these capabilities.

== Query

Crux supports a Datalog query interface for reading data and traversing
relationships across all documents. Queries are executed so that the results
are lazily streamed from the underlying indexes.

Crux is ultimately a store of versioned EDN documents. The fields within these
documents are automatically indexed as Entity-Attribute-Value triples to
support efficient graph queries.

<<queries.adoc#,Read more about how to query your data with Crux.>>

== Schemaless

Crux does not enforce any schema for the documents it stores. One reason for
this is that data might come from many different places, and may not ultimately
be owned by the service using Crux to query the data. This design enables
schema-on-write and/or schema-on-read to be achieved outside of the core of
Crux to meet the exact application requirements.

== Distributed

Nodes can come and go, with local indexes stored in a Key/Value store such as
RocksDB, whilst reading and writing master data to central log topics (only
Kafka is currently supported). Queries are not distributed and there is no
sharding of documents across nodes.

Crux can also run in a non-distributed "standalone" mode, where the transaction
and document logs exist only inside of a local Key/Value store such as RocksDB.
This is appropriate for non-critical usage where availability and durability
requirements do not justify the need for Kafka.

== Eviction

Crux supports eviction of active and historical data to assist with technical
compliance for information privacy regulations.

The main transaction log contains only hashes and is immutable. All document
content is stored in a dedicated document log that can be evicted by
compaction.
