= crux-uberjar

This project runs `lein uberjar` and pulls in all of the other `crux-*`
components. It is not appropriate for use as a production dependency in your
application because it will also include logging dependencies. However, it is a
convenient way to depend on Crux whilst in development.

An uberjar is a single jar file that contains the contents of all your
dependencies. Users can run it with a simple java invocation, or on some
systems just by double-clicking the jar file.
