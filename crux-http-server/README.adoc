= crux-http-server

This project contains a complete mapping of Crux APIs to HTTP endpoints that
are exposed when running `start-http-server` using Ring middleware and Jetty.
This can be used in conjunction with both cluster-node mode and standalone
mode.  A `:server-port` number and CORS configuration may also be provided.

For tests, see usage of `/crux-test/test/crux/fixtures/http_server.clj`.
