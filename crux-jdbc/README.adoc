= crux-jdbc

This project contains `crux.jdbc` which is an implementation of `TxLog` backed
by a JDBC-compatible database of your choosing, for strong durability
guarantees in situations where Kafka cannot be used and scalability is less
important. This implementation provides the same semantics as the `crux-kafka`.

This module has currently has tested support for:
* H2
* SQLite
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle

H2 and SQLite may be embedded within your application as a standalone Crux node.

For tests, see `/crux-test/test/crux/jdbc_test.clj`.
